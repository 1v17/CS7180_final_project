# Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve Implementation for Mem0 Chatbot

## Project Overview

Enhance the existing chatbot with human-like memory that naturally forgets information over time following the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve. This will make the chatbot's memory more efficient and realistic by:

- Automatically decaying memory strength over time
- Strengthening memories when retrieved (testing effect)
- Removing or archiving weak memories
- Implementing spaced repetition for important information

## Current Architecture

- **ChatBot Class**: Main chatbot using local LLM + Mem0 for memory
- **Memory System**: Mem0 with OpenAI/GPT-3.5-turbo for memory operations
- **Storage**: Vector database for semantic search

## Implementation Notes for Copilot

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic decay formula, then add complexity
- **Preserve Compatibility**: Ensure existing chatbot functionality remains intact
- **Use Metadata**: Leverage Mem0's metadata system for strength tracking
- **Async Operations**: Use async for background tasks to avoid blocking
- **Configurable**: Make all parameters adjustable via configuration
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle memories without strength metadata
- **Performance**: Batch operations where possible

## Configuration Parameters

```python
{
    "memory_mode": "standard",  # "standard" or "ebbinghaus"
    "forgetting_curve": {
        "enabled": False,               # Controlled by memory_mode
        "initial_strength": 1,              # Base strength
        "min_retention_threshold": 0.1,  # Minimum strength to keep
        "retrieval_boost": 0.5,         # Strength increase on retrieval
        "soft_delete": True,            # Archive vs delete
        "maintenance_interval": 60,   # Seconds between strength updates (3600=1hr for production, 60=1min for testing)
    }
}
```

## API Constraints and Adaptations (Phase 5 Discoveries)

During Phase 5 implementation, several Mem0 API limitations were discovered that required design adaptations:

### Identified API Limitations

1. **`Memory.update(metadata=...)` not supported**
   - **Impact**: Cannot directly update memory strength metadata
   - **Workaround**: Skip direct metadata updates, use natural access patterns during chat

2. **Operations require user/agent/run ID**
   - **Impact**: Statistics and batch operations need proper context
   - **Workaround**: Use default user context and provide clear messaging when context unavailable

3. **No user enumeration capability**
   - **Impact**: Cannot iterate through all users for global maintenance
   - **Workaround**: Focus on per-user operations during chat interactions

4. **Dictionary return format inconsistency**
   - **Impact**: `get_all()` sometimes returns `{"results": [...]}` instead of direct list
   - **Workaround**: Comprehensive format detection and handling for both formats

5. **Error return type inconsistency**
   - **Impact**: Methods may return strings instead of dictionaries on error
   - **Workaround**: Type checking and guaranteed dictionary returns with error information

### Design Adaptations

- **Natural Operations**: Memory management integrated into normal chat flow rather than batch processing
- **Probabilistic Forgetting**: 10% chance per interaction to trigger cleanup (API constraint-driven design)
- **Content-Based Archiving**: Soft delete using `[ARCHIVED]` prefixes rather than metadata flags
- **User Context Management**: All operations properly scoped to user sessions
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating when operations unavailable
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type checking for all API interactions

## Critical Architectural Decision (Phase 6): Memory Scheduler Removal

**Decision Date**: August 4, 2025  
**Impact**: System architecture simplified for improved reliability

### Background and Rationale
During Phase 6 comprehensive testing, a fundamental limitation was discovered with the automatic memory maintenance scheduler. The Mem0 API does not provide native support for updating memory retention rates or strength values in place, which prevented the scheduler from effectively maintaining the Ebbinghaus decay simulation as intended.

### Attempted Solutions
1. **Direct Update Approach**: Failed due to API limitations preventing direct memory strength updates
2. **Delete-and-Recreate Workaround**: Proved unreliable and potentially destructive to user data

### Final Decision
**The MemoryMaintenanceScheduler component was removed** from the production system to prioritize:

## Implementation Plan (Step-by-Step)

1. ✅ Created `ebbinghaus_memory.py` that extends Mem0's Memory class
2. ✅ Added `memory_mode` parameter to `__init__()` method with validation
3. ✅ Overrode `add()` method to conditionally include strength metadata:

   - In "standard" mode: uses standard Mem0 behavior
   - In "ebbinghaus" mode: adds comprehensive strength metadata:
     - `created_at`: timestamp
     - `last_accessed`: timestamp
     - `memory_strength`: float (0.0-1.0)
     - `access_count`: integer
     - `mode`: "ebbinghaus" identifier

4. ✅ Implemented `set_memory_mode()` method to switch modes dynamically
5. ✅ Implemented `calculate_retention()` method with mode checking:
   ```python
   if self.memory_mode == "standard":
       return 1.0  # Perfect retention in standard mode
   else:
       return e^(-time_elapsed_hours / (24 * strength))
